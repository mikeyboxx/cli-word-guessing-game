# Command-line Word Guessing Game 

## Description

This is a command-line tool that allows a developer to play an interactive word guessing game. This game is similar to hangman, where the user is prompted with a word to guess. User must enter one letter at a time, until he/she guesses the word, or has exhausted 10 tries. 

Once user guesses all characters, a winner message is displayed, and a new word is generated. If the 10 tries were exhausted, then a Game Over message is displayed, and the user is prompted to continue or quit.
